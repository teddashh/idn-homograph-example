# IDN Homograph Attack Awareness Demo

**English** · [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

A single-page, bilingual demo for showing coworkers how an IDN homograph attack hides a fake domain behind a familiar spelling.

**Project page:** https://teddashh.github.io/idn-homograph-example/

**Live demo:** https://project-9ogsa.vercel.app

The whole demo is one static `index.html` with a 中文 / English toggle, written in April 2026 as a SOC study note. It opens with a question (which of these two links is fake?), walks through a seven-step phishing kill chain based on [BBC reporting](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly00jnnxypo) on Booking.com "reservation hijack" scams, explains why the Latin and Cyrillic letters look identical, and ends with a defense checklist.

The example brand, Example Bank, is fictional. Its real domain, `examplebank.example`, and the lookalike (the first a swapped for a Cyrillic а, which the browser turns into `xn--exmplebank-0qi.example`) both sit under `.example`, a top-level domain that RFC 2606 reserves for examples, so nobody can register either one.

## Preview locally

Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teddashh/idn-homograph-example
cd idn-homograph-example
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploy your own copy

For coworkers who want to rebuild this demo from the template. There is no build step: Vercel serves `index.html` as is, and `vercel.json` adds the response headers.

### Option A: Vercel CLI (about two minutes)

```bash
# install the CLI if you do not have it yet
npm install -g vercel

# from the project folder
cd idn-homograph-example
vercel
```

The first run asks a few setup questions; the defaults are fine. When it finishes you get a `https://<project>.vercel.app` URL. The first deployment of a new project always goes to production. After that, `vercel` creates a preview deployment and `vercel --prod` updates production.

### Option B: import from GitHub (for ongoing updates)

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to https://vercel.com/new
3. Import that repository.
4. Set Framework Preset to **Other** (it is a plain static site).
5. Leave Build Command and Output Directory empty.
6. Click Deploy. Later pushes to the production branch redeploy automatically.

### Option C: drag and drop (simplest, for a one-off)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/drop
2. Drag the project folder, or a `.zip` of it, onto the page.

## How to present it

Suggested flow:

1. **Open the page and ask:** "Which of these two links is fake?" Most people cannot tell, or guess wrong.
2. **Have them click the second link.** The address bar shows an `xn--` Punycode name instead of the familiar spelling.
3. **Explain why:** the Cyrillic а (U+0430) and the Latin a (U+0061) look the same on screen but are different characters.
4. **Connect it to the Booking.com case:** this is how guests in the recent news were tricked.
5. **Close with defenses:** MFA, do not log in or pay from links in messages, and check the root domain at the right end of the address.

## Notes

- Neither link is supposed to load. Both domains are reserved and never resolve, so expect a "site can't be reached" error (or a browser warning on the fake one). That is expected, not a bug: the lesson is in the address bar.
- If the browser shows the `xn--` form even in the link text, its homograph protection is working. That is a good teaching point in itself.
- The page carries a `noindex, nofollow` robots meta tag, and `vercel.json` sends the same `X-Robots-Tag` header, so the deployment stays out of search results. `vercel.json` also sends `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.
- The $2,000 and 580% figures in the kill chain are not in the linked BBC article. Check their sources before you quote them.

## Customize

- **Example brand and domains:** the fictional brand name (Example Bank) appears in the page title, the header, the note under the demo links, and the footer. The real and lookalike domains appear in both demo links (link text and `href`), the address-bar hint, the "Why can't you spot it?" explanation, the "How attackers weaponize it" list, and the checklist. Search `index.html` for `mplebank`, which matches the real domain, the lookalike, and its `xn--` form, replace every occurrence, then recompute the Punycode form. For example, `python3 -c 'print("exаmplebank.example".encode("idna"))'` (the `а` in that string is Cyrillic) prints `b'xn--exmplebank-0qi.example'`. Keep both names under a reserved top-level domain such as `.example` or `.test` (RFC 2606, RFC 6761). A lookalike under a real top-level domain is a name that anyone could register.
- **Logo:** the `.brand-mark` block holds a small inline SVG (a generic bank icon), so the page loads no external images. Replace the SVG to change it.
- **More lookalike letters:** add rows to the `.char-table` block in the same format (a Latin cell, a Cyrillic cell, then the 一模一樣 / Identical cells).
- **Colors:** edit the CSS variables in `:root` at the top of `index.html`.
